# java.nio.package

Implemented a client-server application and their communication over network with non-blocking I/O (java.nio package). 
I build a simple NIO server which accept connection from client. 
Then if connection request accepted, a number between 0-9 randomly generated. This number will be compared with the value which is sent by the client. 
After connection is opened, user send a number between 0-9. Client get response for the numbers.
